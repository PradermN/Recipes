# recipes

The recipes application is a web application whose dynamism was created with php. Users must connect to the platform by entering identifiers after which they have the possibility of consulting the different recipes of other users, but also of adding recipes.


To create the application we needed Apache which is a web server allowing you to manage static web pages, then php is the Apache plug-in allowing you to manage dynamic web pages. Finally, we also needed MySql for database management. Fortunately, there is the MAMP package which brings together all these elements in one with the support of PhpMyAdmin which makes it very easy to create database management tables.


So don't hesitate any longer and share your recipe too!!! :)
